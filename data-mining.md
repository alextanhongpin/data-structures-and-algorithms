Data mining algorithms


There are several algorithms available out there, but not many places examines how to use them correctly. The definition of correctness here refers to the actual value derived from them

This kind of algorithm should actually answer the following:

- Can it be applied to your data 
- Does the result bring business value when you apply this algorithm (e.g. determining the most likely churn, most likely items they purchase).
- Can those results be quantified? Adding 10 % increase in sales, 50% more certain that the user will purchase it.
- Are the results consistent? When we apply it again in the future, it will still return similar results.

Let’s take a look at the following algorithms


- Decision tree
- Page rank
- Apriori/eclat (frequent item set mining)
- Linear regression algorithm
- Classifier algorithm
- Collaborative filtering algorithm (this is more on recommendation)
- Clustering algorithms


We should break down the analysis into different part

- How to apply it (what input is required, what output is required)
- What kind of results to expect (if I do this, then this will result in …)
- What kind of metrics to expect (it will increase the sales by 10 %)
- How is it better than when we don’t apply it (null hypothesis)
- How can we explain it in layman terms (or through diagrams). Or to technical people.
- What are the limitations of such algorithm (what it solves and what it doesn’t solves)
