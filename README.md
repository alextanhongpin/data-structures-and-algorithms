# Data Structures and Algorithms


Interesting data structures and algorithms that I learn, implemented in different languages and test cases.

## Affinity Analysis

See repo here

## Path-finding

Tic-tac-toe repo here 


## String algorithm

- Boyer Moore (used in grep)
- Levenshtein distance (user for edit-distance calculation)
- BK-tree can be used in conjunction with levenshtein for spell-checking
