# Data Structures and Algorithms


Interesting data structures and algorithms that I learn, implemented in different languages and test cases.


Other algorithms not in this repo:
- [algorithm-x](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/algorithm-x) for solving sudoku
- [affinity-analysis](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/affinity-analysis) for market basket analysis
- [viterbi and hidden markov model](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/hidden-markov-model)
- [base62](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/go-base62) for url shortener
- [celebrity problem](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/celebrity-problem)
- [bandit-algorithm](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/go-bandit) as an alternative to A/B testing, and also used for dynamic pricing

## String algorithm

- Boyer Moore (used in grep)
- Levenshtein distance (user for edit-distance calculation)
- BK-tree can be used in conjunction with levenshtein for spell-checking
